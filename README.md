# USlack #

[USlack](https://uslack.onrender.com/) is a full stack clone of Slack that uses Ruby on Rails, React/Redux, web-sockets  and psql to provide a live messaging service! USlack allows you create multiple workspaces in order for your to separate your different priorities and groups. You can also create public or private channels or even groups. You have the freedom to join, leave and edit these channels as well as add new members. With fully functional search it makes it easy to find individuals or channels to accomplish what you would want in a work environment. With websockets, not only do you have live messaging but when you start a new conversation or channel, any online users will instantly have that conversation be added to their sidebar.
